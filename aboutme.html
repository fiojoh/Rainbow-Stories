          Storytelling is one of the oldest art forms in human civilisation. Cave
          drawings from 40,000 years ago depict images that tell stories of Stone
          Age life, before language as we know it today was fully developed. From
          that very early start, language developed first orally, with stories
          passed down through the generations, until such time that they could be
          written down.
          <br /><br />
          In a similar manner, a child must first learn to listen, then speak,
          then read and only then can they learn to write. Using the art of
          storytelling today encourages and helps children with these skills.
          Listening to a story being told, as opposed to a story being read from a
          book, helps children become fully immersed in the story through the
          storyteller’s actions, voice, intonation, interaction with the audience,
          as well as through their own imagination.
          <br /><br />
          Through the careful choice of stories, particularly using those with
          some repetitive and known structures, storytelling with Rainbow Stories
          enables children to lose their apprehensions quickly and to join in, as
          they gain confidence, in retelling the story. There are only 7 basic
          plots around which every fictional story is based , and so the more
          often children are exposed to the different themes, the more confident
          they become in telling their own versions of the stories. The more
          confident they become, the more eloquent their vocabulary and oral
          delivery becomes.
          <br /><br />
          My experience from 7 years of storytelling with primary school aged
          children is that, once they can confidently tell a story orally, writing
          their own version becomes much easier and their literacy skills improve
          quickly. They are no longer thinking so much about the trajectory of
          their story and can concentrate on the important aspects of literacy,
          such as Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPAG)! In addition, having
          discovered that writing a longer story is possible, the child gains in
          confidence that they can write, that they can actually tell stories and
          are, as a result, happier to try again with a story of their own.
          <br /><br />
          In the age of modern technology, speaking and listening skills are
          becoming less used and consequently children are joining Reception
          Classes less able to communicate effectively. If children struggle to
          speak and listen, moving onto reading and writing will naturally be
          harder for them. A sound basis in oral vocabulary is essential for the
          child’s subsequent written vocabulary. In addition, storytelling has
          been shown to improve comprehension skills and to encourage a more 
          diverse vocabulary than simply being read to .
          <br /><br />
          Storytelling can have a positive impact on children, not only by
          strengthening their imagination and language skills, but opening up the
          world around them, how other people think, information about unknown
          places and different times. By giving children the confidence to tell
          stories, they are given the confidence to understand the world around
          them, empathise with others and have the ability to make themselves
          heard and understood.
