        "Fiona is a talented storyteller and was highly successful at working
        with the school English Lead in initiating storytelling through the
        school. She spent time with vulnerable learners and whole classes
        developing storytelling skills, developing children’s confidence when
        performing stories to others, and expanding children’s vocabulary choice
        and understanding of sentence structure. Using this approach to link
        reading to writing has been key in raising our achievement in writing
        (we are now in the top 20% of schools and sig above national at the end
        of KS2). Fiona took total responsibility for organising and planning
        storytelling sessions and they were of a very high quality. She is
        highly creative and liaised with teaching staff to ensure that her work
        was relevant to the current theme in the class. Together with the
        English Lead she organised whole school book weeks, with many exciting
        activities. She led whole class and large group activities with
        confidence.”

    <h1>Deputy Head / Year 3 Teacher</h1>
      <p>
        Fiona has worked with our children in a storytelling role for over 6
        years now and has contributed hugely to all areas of Literacy within our
        school which have been greatly appreciated. She has worked flexibly
        alongside teachers in every class to meet the needs of each particular
        cohort. This role has varied according to the ability and confidence of
        the cohort. In Year R this has included scribing and acting out
        helicopter stories, combined with whole class and small group
        storytelling in front of audiences of parents and other members of the
        school community in order to raise oracy and speaking and listening. In
        Year 1 and 2 she has developed the children’s storytelling skills by
        working with small groups to retell familiar tales. In KS2 she has
        researched stories that link in with the topic and has rehearsed chapter
        stories with the children so they can retell a whole story in bite-sized
        chunks with all the class performing at some part of the story.
        <br /><br />
        Fiona plans the stories with the children using Pie Corbett’s highly
        successful ‘Talk for Writing’ principles, mapping out using pictures and
        modelling using signs to help the children recall in a more confident
        matter. Children learn to rehearse plots and then use this framework on
        which to base their own written stories. The quality of writing has
        greatly improved by applying these story telling principles. I have been
        very impressed at the rate at which the children can learn using this
        method and the enthusiasm they show during performance. One Year 5 group
        containing a few very under confident children learnt the whole of ‘The
        Owl and The Pussycat’ from beginning to a very confident word-perfect
        performance in a period of 45 minutes. The pride with which they
        recalled the poem was palpable.
        <br /><br />
        Success with some of our SEND children has also been evident, with Fiona
        working alongside those with speech and language difficulties in a
        similar manner, building confidence through storytelling seamlessly
        incorporating phonics and pronunciation to improve speaking skills.
        Alongside working with both children and staff, Fiona has led our most
        recent Parent Workshops (which attract 85%+ of our parents) focusing on
        how parents can support reading into writing, explaining confidently the
        importance of reading, giving practical tips and explaining to parents
        how best to support writing at home through the enjoyment of reading and
        rehearsing and talking about stories at the appropriate age level.
        <br /><br />
        She has also visited pre-schools and nurseries as part of thorough
        transition work into our school, with glowing reports.
        <br /><br />
        Full of innovative ideas and through her enthusiasm encouraging mass
        staff participation, Fiona has also planned and executed some excellent
        projects as part of Book Week- themes like Where’s Wally, The Accidental
        Prime Minister and most recently No Pens Day have all been a huge
        success. I have seen the impact Fiona’s role has had on every pupil (she
        works on rotation with all 195 children) and am convinced that the
        children’s love of reading and confidence in story telling is due to her
        enthusiasm and her investment in our children over the years. The impact
        is seen numerically through excellent results in both reading and now
        more so writing at both KS1 and KS2.

      <h1>Reception Teacher / SENCO</h1>
      <p>
        It would be my pleasure as the difference you’ve made to our pupils has
        been HUGE!
        <br /><br />
        Actually I say pupils, I saw Mrs Hayter [Class Teaching Assistant] using
        your framework for storytelling last week with my class when I’d dipped
        out for a short time and asked her to take over. I think your input has
        been far-reaching and certainly for me, it’s not something that will be
        forgotten.
        <br /><br />
        Their confidence for storytelling , talking in general and the impact on
        their early oracy skills has been evidenced this year through our
        amazing end of year assessment results where all but one child achieved
        the Expected levels despite some low starting points on entry.
        <br /><br />
        I also believe that their writing has improved as a result of your
        input. Being able to say their sentences ahead of writing them is such a
        simple but useful tool!
        <br /><br />
        It goes without saying how much my class looked forward to your Thursday
        afternoon visits. It’s been especially lovely to see the likes of JR,
        who at the beginning of the year would just sit and watch, joining in
        with enthusiasm!
        <br /><br />
        The biggest difference and biggest impact has been in the confidence of
        the children you work with.
      </p>

      <h1>Year 2 Teacher</h1>
      <p>
        Your storytelling work in school is invaluable. Even the least confident
        children gain so much from it. Sadly with the preparation necessary to
        make a good storytelling session work well, Class Teachers don’t have
        the time (or often the expertise) to make this a regular part of their
        week. For children who find reading a challenge, for whatever reason,
        storytelling is a way of enjoying stories that they may be unable to
        access themselves and it’s an aid to writing as you’ve already condensed
        sometimes lengthy stories into sections that the children then find
        easier to write.”
      </p>

      <h1>Year 4 Teacher</h1>
      <p>
        Over the past 2 years, Fiona has worked tirelessly to create imaginative
        lessons and delivered them to my class. She captivates children and
        transforms them into a different world through her use of props, voices
        and actions. <br /><br />
        She also helps children to remember stories through simple actions and
        pictures.
        <br /><br />
        I thoroughly recommend her services, she's enthusiastic and child
        centred and can differentiate to enthuse children from aged 4-11.
      </p>

      <h1>Year 5 Teacher</h1>
      <p>
        I first met Fiona five years ago when I joined Winterbourne Earls
        Primary School. Fiona has been a valuable asset in our school and my
        Year 5 classes over the year promoting the importance and enjoyment of
        reading.
        <br /><br />
        Fiona’s storytelling sessions are mesmerising and inspiring. She tells
        all stories from memory which I find astonishing and the children
        absolutely love, even the older ones! Fiona has always linked our
        storytelling sessions with our class topics to make them not only very
        enjoyable but also informative. The children have the chance to all be
        involved, either speaking individually or as a group, and perform their
        stories to the school.
        <br /><br />
        Fiona has also worked with some children in my classes on their speaking
        and listening skills. She has taken groups for vocabulary sessions in
        order to broaden their vocabulary and understand how to use thesauruses
        to aid their writing. This has made a significant impact on their
        writing quality and desire to use more effective language.
        <br /><br />
        Fiona is amazing with the children and puts in an enormous amount of
        preparation to her sessions. She has delivered amazing Book Week
        launches, reading challenges and library promotions. She has even run a
        book club which my class absolutely loved and were devastated when it
        has to move to a different year group!
        <br /><br />
        All in all, Fiona is a wonderful advocate of reading for enjoyment and
        any school would be lucky to have her.
      </p>

      <h1>Year 6 Teacher</h1>
      <p>I have worked with Fiona for the past four years. She has come in and delivered many inspirational and thought provoking stories as well as enabling the children to create and perform their own. The benefits of this far outstretch the individual session as there is such a long lasting effect on the children’s understanding of how a story is constructed to writing their own work in a much more detailed and competent way. Not only does it assist children in their writing, but the children develop a real love for books and in turn this shared enjoyment brings the class together as they perform their own story. The children are always keen to take part in the sessions and it has been amazing to see how their skills have developed over the years. As a teacher of KS2, I am particularly impressed by the choice of stories she choses to share with the children. They are stories that the children won’t have come across, thus opening their eyes to a wealth of literature beyond their familiar texts. In today’s hectic curriculum, space needs to be made for children’s voices to get heard and each individual to feel able to contribute within the whole class with confidence whilst co-operating with others as this has such a big impact on the individuals learning.
