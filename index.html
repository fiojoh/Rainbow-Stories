        <p class="text">
          I feel passionately about the importance of promoting oral literacy in
          children - starting as young as possible to help them in the
          development of their reading and writing. However, what I have loved
          most is watching the children find their voices, develop their
          imagination and how their confidence grows with public speaking and
          performance the more opportunity they have to share their stories with
          their peers and adults.

          "Camping in a field in Devon...fire burning and lights fading. V has
          just stood up in front of 8 people and told the whole of the little
          red hen with actions without any prompts just the way they did it with
          you. We haven’t talked about it since the week you did it. It was
          amazing. So proud of her and huge thank you to you for sharing the
          love of stories. You should have seen my mum’s face...and considering
          she spent 20 years teaching she was still blown away!” Parent of a 5
          year old pupil
