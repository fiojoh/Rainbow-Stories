      <h1>Telling Stories Round the Campfire</h1>
      <p>
        "Camping in a field in Devon...fire burning and lights fading. V has
        just stood up in front of 8 people and told the whole of the little red
        hen with actions without any prompts just the way they did it with you.
        We haven’t talked about it since the week you did it. It was amazing. So
        proud of her and huge thank you to you for sharing the love of stories.
        You should have seen my mum’s face...and considering she spent 20 years
        teaching she was still blown away!” Parent of a 5 year old pupil

        <h1>What I do</h1>
        <p>
          I feel passionately about the importance of promoting oral literacy in
          children - starting as young as possible to help them in the development
          of their reading and writing. However, what I have loved most is
          watching the children find their voices, develop their imagination and
          how their confidence grows with public speaking and performance the more
          opportunity they have to share their stories with their peers and
          adults.
