    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>Storytelling is one of the oldest art forms in human civilisation.  Cave drawings from 40,000 years ago depict images that tell stories of Stone Age life, before language as we know it today was fully developed.  From that very early start, language developed first orally, with stories passed down through the generations, until such time that they could be written down. 
      <br><br>
      In a similar manner, a child must first learn to listen, then speak, then read and only then can they learn to write.  Using the art of storytelling today encourages and helps children with these skills.  Listening to a story being told, as opposed to a story being read from a book, helps children become fully immersed in the story through the storyteller’s actions, voice, intonation, interaction with the audience, as well as through their own imagination.  In fact, research into mirror neurons has shown that as people watch the actions, their brains actually imagine they themselves are performing that action too.  Therefore, while children sit in the classroom watching a storytelling performance, their brains and imaginations really are flying on that magic carpet, walking through that forest and experiencing events beyond their every day world.  
      <br><br>
      My experience of storytelling with primary school aged children is that, once they can confidently tell a story orally, writing their own version becomes much easier and their literacy skills can improve.  They are no longer thinking so much about the trajectory of their story and can concentrate on the important aspects of literacy, such as Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPAG)!  In addition, having discovered that writing a longer story is possible, the child gains in confidence that they can write, that they can actually tell stories and are, as a result, happier to try again with a story of their own.
      <br><br>
      Through the careful choice of stories, particularly using those with some repetitive and known structures, storytelling enables children to lose their apprehensions quickly and to join in, as they gain confidence, in retelling the story.  There are only 7 basic plots around which every fictional story is based, and so the more often children are exposed to the different themes, the more confident they become in telling their own versions of the stories.  The more confident they become, the more eloquent their vocabulary and oral delivery becomes.
      <br><br>
      An article in the Guardian newspaper in 2017 by Tim Lott, reported on a secondary teacher who had bemoaned that his year 7 intake no longer knew how to tell a story “They knew what a fronted adverbial was, and how to spot an internal clause, and even what a proposition was – but when I set them a task to write a story, they broke down and cried.”  The Guardian article went on to sing the praises of the benefits of storytelling in primary schools to aid children with their story ideas above and beyond the focus on grammar.  This is my experience too – if you give the children the structure, language, vocabulary and ideas from oral stories, they can use these on which to base their own writing.  Storytelling acts as the link between reading and writing – it allows children to practise their ideas and feel the flow of the story before they commit pen to paper. 
      <br><br>
      The younger and more often a child experiences oral storytelling, the better the outcome for that child.  In the age of modern technology, speaking and listening skills are becoming less used and consequently children are joining Reception Classes less able to communicate effectively.  If children struggle to speak and listen, moving onto reading and writing will naturally be harder for them.  A sound basis in oral vocabulary is essential for the child’s subsequent written vocabulary.  In addition, storytelling has been shown to improve comprehension skills and to encourage a more diverse vocabulary than simply being read to.
      <br><br>
    Storytelling can have a positive impact on children, not only by strengthening their imagination and language skills, but opening up the world around them, how other people think, information about unknown places and different times.  By giving children the confidence to tell stories, they are given the confidence to understand the world around them, empathise with others and have the ability to make themselves heard and understood.</p>

    <h1>Links with the National Curriculum</h1>
    <p>
      As stated in the current National Curriculum, a high-quality education in English will teach pupils to speak and write fluently so that they can communicate their ideas and emotions to others and through their reading and listening, others can communicate with them.  Pupils who do not learn to speak, read and write fluently and confidently are effectively disenfranchised.
      <br><br>
      Gill Jones, Ofsted’s Deputy Director of Early Education reported in an article in 2018 for the Times Educational Supplement on the importance of Early Years education with emphasis on the importance of reading at the heart of the EYFS education.  She went on to clarify that “it’s by singing and hearing stories that children gain an understanding of what words actually mean. I’m talking about comprehension.  And I’ve yet to meet a young child who did not enjoy listening to a story or singing a song with their fellow classmates.”
      <br><br>
      Throughout, the English curriculum, the benefits of listening to stories, poems and non-fiction they cannot yet read for themselves is mentioned. This means they can begin to understand how language can be structured. Storytelling allows children to be exposed to wide variety of vocabulary, language sounds and grammatical structure beyond their reading age, which they will hopefully go on to use in their own writing of their stories.

    <h1>Working With Parents</h1>
    <p>
      I feel passionately about the importance of promoting oral literacy in children - starting as young as possible to help them in the development of their reading and writing.  However, what I have loved most is watching the children find their voices, develop their imagination and how their confidence grows with public speaking and performance the more opportunity they have to share their stories with their peers and adults.
